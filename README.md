 **Here's a summary of the React app's functionality:**

**Key Features:**

- **Image Search:**
    - Fetches images from the Unsplash API based on user-entered search queries.
    - Displays image thumbnails with details like owner name, username, profile image, likes, and download link.
    - Offers pagination to navigate multiple pages of results.
- **Theme Switching:**
    - Allows users to toggle between light and dark themes for app appearance customization.
- **Loading Indicator:**
    - Displays a loading indicator while image data is being fetched.

**Components:**

- **App:** Main component, manages state, handles events, and renders UI.
- **Themecontext:** Provides theme-related values to child components.
- **ImageCard:** Renders individual image thumbnails with associated details.
- **NavBar:** Likely a navigation bar component for other app sections (implementation not provided).

**Functionality:**

1. **User Input:**
    - User enters a search query in the input field.
    - User clicks the "submit" button or presses Enter.
2. **Data Fetching:**
    - App fetches images from Unsplash API using provided query and API key.
    - App updates state with fetched images and total pages.
3. **Rendering:**
    - App displays image thumbnails using `ImageCard` component.
    - App displays pagination controls for navigating results.
4. **Theming:**
    - User can toggle between light and dark themes using a switch.
    - Theme context updates theme values for components.

**Additional Notes:**

- Employs React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` for state management, side effects, and DOM references.
- Leverages `axios` library for making API calls.
- Considers error handling during data fetching.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
